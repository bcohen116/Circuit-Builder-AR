# Circuit-Builder-AR
2019 Revolution UC Hackathon project. Point your camera at a circuit and see how to wire it up.

**Notes:** This was a 24 hour Hackathon project, so I only was able to create this for one circuit. For best results, mimic the video from this page https://devpost.com/software/circuit-builder-ar

## What do I need?
* Android phone (must be fairly new version to be compatible)
* A method to put an apk onto your phone. (Android Studio, physical cable, etc...)
* Ultrasonic sensor, Raspberry Pi 3

## How do I run this?
* Simply add the apk to your phone and open the app.
* It only works for the circuit mentioned above.


## Common Problems
* I can't see the AR
  * The AR only shows up if the program can recognize both the Pi and the sensor in the same camera screen. Try positioning them like I have it in the video in the link above for best results.
